ðŸ¦ˆ The Superdense Coding Protocol!ðŸ¦ˆ
=====================================
What is the Superdense Coding Protocol?
---------------------------------------
In this project, I explored the world of Quantum Cryptography, and learned about the Superdense Coding Protocol.
The SDC Protocol is a type of Quantum Cryptography, in which two classical bits of information are trabsmitted using one qubit.
This is like a flipped version of Quantum teleportation, which you can read about [here](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/teleportation.html).
Quantum Teleportation is the process of transmitting one qubit using two classical bits;
it's basically like destroying the quantum state of a qubit and recreating it elsewhere.
There are three steps to the Superdense Coding Protocol, which are
1. *Preparation*
2. *Encoding*
3. *Decoding*
   
### Step One: Preparation
